# TinyDungeonNotes

This addon displays some notes about the current dungeon in the top left
of the screen.

For example, in Mana-Tombs it displays this:
```
Nexus Terror - fear
Pandemonius - reflect
Darkcaster - mana burn
Theurgist - sheep
```
The notes name the most dangerous mobs and their spells so the tank can mark them
with a skull or pull them way back.

Currently, there aren't any options at all.
