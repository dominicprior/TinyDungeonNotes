# TinyDungeonNotes

This addon displays some notes about the current dungeon.  It simply
lists some of the more dangerous mobs and their abilities.

For example, in Mana-Tombs it displays this:
```
Nexus Terror - fear
Pandemonius - reflect
Darkcaster - mana burn
Theurgist - sheep
```
Currently, there aren't any options at all.  For example, the info
is always displayed in the top left of the screen.

So far, it just has info for the Outland dungeons.
